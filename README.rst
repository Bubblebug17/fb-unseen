Sick of the new "seen" feature of facebook? Block the read receipts with this
extensions and your friends will no longer be able to see if you read their
messages. You will still be able to see if they read your messages.

Attention: If you are loading the "full conversation" page (Messages Â» Name of
your friend), it will get marked as "read" and your friend will see it!

One drawback of this extension is that all your messages will not be marked as
read for yourself, too, and the "unread messages" notification stays visible
as long as you do not reply, open the full conversation, or mark it explicity
as read.
